# The Ultimate C and C++ Guide

## Before you begin

### Steps to run a single file.
1) Install C++.
2) Open your command line application.
3) Change directory to the folder of the file.
4) Compile the file with this command: `gcc FILENAME.c -o FILENAME`.
    - Example: `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`
5) Run the file with this command: `./FILENAME.exe`.
    - Example: `./hello_world`
6) Your terminal should output: `Hello World!`. If you have errors, try step 1 again or
    otherwise get ready to learn the most frustating element of programming: DEBUGGING!
    Good luck:).

### Commenting
- Comments are sections in your code that do NOT run, but explains things.
- Comments are used to describe files, code blocks and even individual lines.
- Comments will be used in this project simply to explain the code.
- Single line comments begin with `//` and multiline comments have two parts: `/*` and `*/`.
- Examples:

    ```
    // This is a single line comment.
    /*
    While this is an example
    on how to write a multiline comment.
    */
    ```
